# Sensor-Controlled-Rayman
 
We created a sensor-controlled controller to play one of the most beloved video games of the 90's - Rayman!
To play, just upload the .ino file to a CPX (Circuit Playground Express) board.

## Controls
```
Press the left button A (D4) - to move left
Press the right Button B (D5) - to move right
Blow on the sound sensor (microphone) - to jump
Blow on the sound sensor again while Rayman is in mid-air - to do a helicopter
Shake and wave your hand - to charge a punch (hand motion is detected by the motion sensor / accelerometer)
Release your hand - to launch a punch
Switch the slide switch - to turn on the cheat mode (cheat: Free movement)
Switch the slide switch again - to turn off the cheat mode
```
